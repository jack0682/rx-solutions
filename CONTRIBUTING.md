# Contributing

RX is a personal project for heterogeneous robots and infrastructure. Contributions use Apache-2.0. Consult the repository README and implementation records for the current validation scope.

## Branches and GitFlow

| Branch | Purpose | PR target |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Stable baseline and release history; default branch | PRs only |
| `develop` | Integration and validation of upcoming work | `main` when ready |
| `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`, `chore/*`, `codex/*` | Work created from `develop` | `develop` |
| `release/*` | Release preparation created from `develop` | `main`, then carry fixes into `develop` |
| `hotfix/*` | Urgent fixes created from `main` | `main`, then carry fixes into `develop` |
| `dependabot/*` | Dependency proposals from this repository | `develop`; security fixes may target `main` |

All PRs use merge commits. Squash and rebase merges are disabled so that reviewed commits, signatures and signoffs retain their identities. A small release can use a `develop` to `main` promotion PR without a release branch. After promotion, merge `main` back to `develop` through a PR.

## Signed commits and the daily workflow

Every commit, including merges, needs both a matching author `Signed-off-by` trailer and a verified OpenPGP signature. Read the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) before signing off. The trailer records your certification of contribution rights; the cryptographic signature authenticates the commit. Neither substitutes for the other.

Configure a verified GitHub email and register your public GPG key, then install the repository's local hooks. See the [repository governance guide](GOVERNANCE.md) for key setup, branch updates, merge and recovery instructions.

```sh
python3 tools/install_git_hooks.py
git switch develop
git pull --ff-only origin develop
git switch -c feature/your-change
# Make the change and run the checks below.
git add <changed-paths>
git commit -s -S -m "Describe the behavior change"
git push -u origin feature/your-change
# Open a PR targeting develop; wait for CI and DCO.
python3 tools/merge_pr.py PR_NUMBER
```

`main` and `develop` reject direct pushes, force pushes and deletion. A PR needs `CI` from GitHub Actions and `DCO` from the DCO app, an up-to-date base, verified signatures and resolved review conversations. A separate update lock permits the administrator to update these branches only through a PR; that exception does not bypass the quality rules.

The required number of approvals is zero while there is only one maintainer. CODEOWNERS identifies review responsibility. The maintainer still reviews the diff and validation evidence before merging. When an independent maintainer joins, raise the required approvals and enable required code-owner review together.

External forks cannot use names such as `main`, `develop`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*` or `dependabot/*` to acquire this repository's release routes. Submit external changes from work branches to `develop`. Fork CI receives a read-only token and no repository secrets.

## Changes and validation

Describe the problem, resulting behavior, checks actually run and unverified scope in the PR. Keep unrelated large cleanups separate from feature work. When changing authority, unknown outcomes, stopping, resource handover or recovery semantics, explain the counterexamples and compatibility impact.

The Rust toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml`, Python 3, Node.js 24 and npm are required. Checks use the pinned `sdk/` without a sibling repository checkout.

```sh
python3 .github/test_repository.py
python3 .github/test_commit_policy.py
python3 tools/check_repository.py
python3 tools/check_device_catalog_sources.py
python3 tools/test_native_inventory.py
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked
cd apps/operator
npm ci
npm run format:check
npm test
npm run test:bundle
npm run build
```

Automatic CI covers the Rust workspace, SDK inventory, device catalog provenance and fixtures, native inventory checker regressions, and operator app static checks, unit tests, bundle tests and builds. It does not include a full ROS/native Docker build, actual C++ BT/ROS process tests, browser E2E tests or physical validation. When changing those boundaries, run the relevant procedures in `tools/`, `native/` and `apps/operator/tests/` separately and record the results in the PR.

CI runs for every PR and pushes to `main`, `develop`, work, release and hotfix branches. It can also be started manually from GitHub Actions. Failed or canceled child checks cannot produce an overall `CI` success. `tools/check_repository.py` checks JSON syntax, local Markdown file links, hashes for eight normative documents and hashes for the two manifests across Git-tracked and non-ignored new files. It does not fetch external URLs, validate Markdown anchors or check the existence of sibling repository files.

## Published content

Use English for source comments, user-facing messages, documentation and contribution templates in this repository. Tests may retain intentional non-ASCII data through explicit Unicode escapes when required to preserve coverage.

Keep AI assistant instructions, prompts and local state out of Git. The ignore rules preserve local tooling files, and repository checks reject publishable assistant artifacts. Ordinary test harnesses and product source remain part of the repository.

## Changes across repositories

Original designs and contracts live in [rx_docs](https://github.com/jack0682/rx_docs), the platform and contract copies in [rx-platform](https://github.com/jack0682/rx-platform), and Host/device/services with the pinned SDK in [rx-solutions](https://github.com/jack0682/rx-solutions). Record the original contract revision, compatibility impact and manifests first, then synchronize platform specs and the solutions SDK. Link the PRs across the three repositories and record compatible commit combinations.

The platform command `python3 tools/check_host_sdk.py ../rx-solutions/sdk` checks agreement with the current platform source. Standalone solutions CI checks its SDK's own inventory; it does not prove compatibility with the latest platform. Run the cross-repository synchronization check when both repositories change. Regenerate SDK copies from platform sources instead of editing them directly.
