# Explicit workflow execution v2 input contract

Implementation in progress. Saved Preview/publication HTTP paths are present;
no v2 operation or Executor ingress is enabled yet.
The authoritative revision decision is [Docs #96](https://github.com/jack0682/rx_docs/pull/96)
and the [semantic contract](https://github.com/jack0682/rx_docs/blob/cc1c0fd839c8aa6060a598ff8ff3e47ea18c56ad/docs/contracts/workflow-execution/v2/README.md).
v2 is the execution version; v1.1 names the existing revision procedure.

## Configuration and plan envelope

`rx.execution-plan.v2` contains an explicit `rx.workflow-execution-binding.v2` and
the existing compiled graph as a **template**. The binding pins the exact publication
reference and policy artifact, with a complete one-to-one compiled-operation-ID to
workflow-node map. This initial profile requires a finite sequence of one operation
per published Task. P checks order, action templates, policy bytes, publication
identity, saved input/index links and current definitions. The wrapper has its own
content digest; it is never served as a v1 resolved recipe with its policy removed.

Cell configuration has an optional `execution` binding. When absent, it is omitted
from serialization and the artifact schema remains `rx.cell-configuration.v1`.
When present, the artifact schema is `rx.cell-configuration.v2`, its recipe is the
v2 plan, and its process field is only the graph template. Configuration storage
verifies the publication link and uses the explicit artifact schema when reopening.
The existing v1 decoder cannot reinterpret the new envelope as a v1 process.

`POST /api/v1/workflow-executions/configuration` accepts a v2 CellConfiguration,
checks cell engineering rights and the complete publication/graph link, and stores
an immutable configuration artifact for change/qualification review. It returns
the reference with `installed=false` and `qualified=false`; it does not replace the
active cell. Applying a reviewed v2 target and qualifying the derived domain remain
unfinished. V1 Run creation, qualification callback, execution-plan reads and new
fixed-input submissions refuse a v2 configuration. Original operation/receipt
recovery is not reinterpreted as a fresh submission.

Part ordinal uses the existing production contract's **one-based** value. Slot and
candidate indices remain zero-based; ordinal 1 selects published slot_order[0].
The v2 selection check rejects ordinal zero and does not change legacy PartAttempt
or visit meaning. New v2 admission still needs its durable actual-object/selection
records; the legacy refusal is not itself execution v2 implementation or case-2
frozen-binary evidence.

## Derived qualification verification

`rx.requalification-policy.v3` is an explicit qualification-policy revision for
SIMULATION profiles. It is not a rename of execution v2 or the v1.1 revision
procedure. Policy v1/v2 retain their original 128-dependency, 8 MiB artifact,
32 MiB total and 30-second ticket limits. V2 configuration targets require policy
v3; its v2 profiles permit at most 1024 dependency references. Only the explicitly
typed execution input closure may be 16 MiB; other individual artifacts remain
limited to 8 MiB. The v3 bundle limit is 128 MiB. Its off-writer computation ticket
is bounded at ten minutes, with all original current-context, rights, policy,
configuration, fencing and revision checks repeated at commit. No operating permit
or physical-profile lifetime is extended.

The existing signed report and independent reviewer path remain mandatory. Before
a report can be marked ready for review, P independently validates the v2
configuration/plan/publication/policy links, all required configuration and package
dependencies, signed template identities and input closure, then recomputes every
candidate/slot and compares each result to the approved index. A valid report
signature and internally consistent artifact hashes cannot excuse a false index.
Definitions count toward the transitive dependency limit even though their bytes
are already inside the verified closure. An omission or conflicting value blocks
the derived verification. Existing non-PASS/NOT_RUN reports can still be recorded
without a successful derived proof; they cannot be approved.

The saved qualification version records `derived` results: exact configuration,
publication, policy and index identities, materializer identity and verified
candidate/slot/report/dependency counts. The field is omitted for legacy versions,
whose version-digest calculation remains unchanged. Versions with derived evidence
use a distinct digest domain. Reviewer verification repeats the computation and
compares the derived record. P also rechecks current definitions and the complete
package registration: persistent store identity, generation, policy fingerprint and
policy-file digest. An ordinary restart can retain that registration; replacing the
store or disabling/re-enabling its authority cannot reuse an old publication approval.

This connects deterministic data verification to the existing qualification
checker; reviewed application of the candidate, v2 Host qualification issuance and
Run/Executor admission are still unfinished. A recorded successful computation is
not activation, device completion or M3 acceptance. Full-domain timing must still
be measured on the final release bundle, as required by the design decision.

`execution_v2` adds closed data types for policy, exhaustive report index and
run-bound selection. `Policy.templates` pins node -> host/normalized finite
Program Intent; `node_contracts` pins the same node keys to implementation,
version, primitive and each parameter's type/unit/frame. Only the parameter
ArtifactRef can vary in a selected action. The fixed template timeout remains
unchanged; the resolved timeout must be positive whole milliseconds within it.

The input closure contains the exact workflow reference, label/spec, complete
definition records and ordered candidate requests. Its reference uses raw SHA-256
of canonical bytes. All candidate requests have slot zero in the closure; the
selected slot is set only during deterministic resolution. Context digests use
`RX-EXECUTION-CONTEXT-v2` with slot normalized to zero. The actual runtime object
instance and its checked values/revision belong in the separate selection record.

The materializer verifies source definition digests, workflow content and object
model binding, calls the existing bounded resolver, and rejects invalid/bounded
reports. It checks the package parameter contracts and emits canonical
`rx.workflow-parameters.v2` assets and `rx.execution-report.v2`. The report binds
the input closure, template digest, compiler identity, candidate/model/slot, full
resolution/provenance/constraint result and concrete node actions. The report
commits to each parameter's bytes through its ArtifactRef. Parameters refer to
inputs/templates, not their containing report, so hashes are acyclic.

Canonical JSON is the existing JCS serializer: quantities use finite `Real`,
counters remain decimal strings, index tuples use bounded JSON integer indices.
Artifact readers check their byte limits before deserialization, require exact
canonical bytes, reject duplicate/unknown members and verify hash/schema/size.
Policy is at most 128 KiB, input closure 16 MiB, report index 2 MiB, report
900,000 bytes and each parameter 64 KiB. The legacy wire decoder stays at 1 MiB.
Index decoding validates the entire ordered Cartesian domain once and creates a
private immutable `ValidatedIndex`; candidate lookup then uses its array position.

Content digests of artifacts/reports are raw SHA-256. Structured policy, context
and template digests use the existing `domain + newline + JCS bytes` convention,
with domains `RX-EXECUTION-POLICY-v2`, `RX-EXECUTION-CONTEXT-v2` and
`RX-EXECUTION-TEMPLATES-v2`. Compiler identity uses
`RX-WORKFLOW-MATERIALIZER-v2` over the materializer, v2 DTO, canonicalizer and
primitive-type source bytes. Qualification must additionally pin the actual
runtime/dependency release closure; this source identity alone is not qualification.

P's `prepare_execution_inputs` reads all candidate inputs in one authorized
transaction and blocks stale workflow/definition references, even for unchanged
values. It returns a non-deserializable computation snapshot. It creates no
publication, Run, operation, receipt or permit. Final publication and every new
effect admission still need currentness rechecks in their own transaction.

Selection comparison assumes the expected record was read from P's authenticated
durable authority boundary. It compares the full record, including Run/Part,
object identity/revision, slot, publication/configuration, generation and report;
it checks exact parameter bytes and the invariant Intent fields. A caller-built
selection DTO or successful pure comparison cannot grant execution rights.

Remaining gate work: signed package verification and qualification dependency evidence,
durable Run/Part selection, explicit P/Executor v2 negotiation/admission and frozen
deployed-v1 injection. Existing v1 source/wire/binding manifests remain unchanged.
No Host/UI v2 implementation is authorized by these pure/preparation tests alone.

## Explicit signed template declaration

The declaration schema is `rx.execution-template-catalog.v2`, stored at
`execution-template-catalog.json` inside a signed `rx.package.v2`
`DEVICE_REFERENCE` package. A v1 fixed-operation catalog never implies permission
to substitute its parameter artifact. The declaration pins installation/cell,
SIMULATION environment, at most 16 named templates (host/normalized finite Program
Intent and exact NodeContract), and the family/profile/adapter source documents.
It has a 128 KiB bound. The initial profile is self-contained; locked package
dependencies and physical declarations are not accepted by this checker.

`VerifiedTemplates` consumes a package already reverified from the registered store
owner under the exact verification-policy fingerprint. It checks the new declaration,
source path/bytes/size, manifest asset declarations, present program/default-parameter
bytes, and exact installation/cell. A workflow template must match both its full
action and parameter contract. This is distinct from selecting a concrete runtime
parameter: only the qualified v2 publication/Run policy can approve that selection.

Qualification dependency extraction retains the manifest, signature, all declared
assets and **every signed file**, including files not used by a selected template.
The 1024-identity bound is checked here; the eventual combined publication closure
must also enforce the total bound across definitions, implementations and packages.
Canonical metadata aliases are retained; conflicting metadata is rejected.

This code establishes signed declaration integrity, not software review, source
semantic consistency, physical qualification or runtime admission. Fresh declaration
verification is mandatory in the publication HTTP path. Software-review and
qualification evidence still need connecting without weakening reviewer separation.
The preexisting v1 device-review
checker and its hashes are unchanged; a v1 approval cannot be relabelled as a v2
variable-input review. Do not close the P/Executor gate based on these checks alone.

## Saved Preview and publication

`POST /api/v1/workflow-executions/preview` accepts the existing request-key mutation
envelope with `PreviewInput`: id, candidate key/object-model/request tuples, slot
count, templates and node contracts. P takes a current authorized snapshot, computes
every candidate outside the writer, then rechecks access and the complete current
input cut in the commit transaction. Any invalid candidate aborts preparation.
No caller-supplied report/index is accepted as evidence. Completed Preview stores
the policy, input closure and exhaustive index; individual reports are regenerated
from the pinned closure and must match the saved index before being returned.

`GET /api/v1/workflow-executions/preview` reads the exact reference (catalog, id,
revision, digest query fields) and policy. `GET .../preview-report` adds candidate
and slot indices and returns the verified deterministic report. Computation stays
outside the writer transaction. Reads of historical Preview do not substitute
current definitions. A different installed materializer is refused, not used to
silently rewrite an old report. This implementation does not yet supply historical
materializer execution across release upgrades.

`POST /api/v1/workflow-executions/publish` takes id, exact Preview reference, cell,
and a complete node -> `{intake, template}` binding map in the mutation envelope.
Preparation checks current catalog/cell rights, saved inputs, package registration,
intake receipt identities and current configuration. No package I/O precedes those
checks. The existing bounded off-writer package worker then reopens each exact
stored object, reloads the pinned trust policy, verifies signatures/content and
matches each signed declaration to the saved Preview action and NodeContract.
There is no caller-supplied PASS field or fallback to a v1 fixed-operation catalog.

Commit requires the original boot, a ticket age below 30 seconds, current rights,
unchanged package registration/configuration and current definition closure. It
atomically saves an immutable publication referencing the Preview and policy,
including the cell, binding map, package manifest/signature/catalog identities,
complete package dependency refs and verification-policy registration.
The combined known definition/package/root count must fit the 1024 dependency
bound; later qualification must also account for runtime and implementation roots.
`GET .../publication`
reads the exact reference. Original-key replay returns the original receipt after
response loss; changed input under the key conflicts. Existing IDs cannot be
overwritten, and access is rechecked on replay. An old Preview remains readable
after a referenced revision changes, but a new publication is blocked. Stale
diagnostics include the pinned/current revision and digest and definition label.

These authoring publications are **not qualified or executable**. Template package
signatures are verified, but software-review and qualification linkage still need
integration before the P/Executor gate is complete. Neither publication nor a `NOT_QUALIFIED` projection
is a qualification approval. No Run/permit/device outbox is created by these APIs.

The existing qualification blob mechanism is shared at application level with
its original namespace/bytes/8 MiB bound preserved. Execution artifacts use a
separate namespace and a 16 MiB bound, with immutable 256 KiB chunks. Individual
store documents and legacy wire messages retain their 1 MiB limits. Policy/index
readers enforce their tighter limits and content/schema identities as well.

The first saved v2 Preview atomically promotes the local store reader barrier to
10; normal v1-only stores stay at 6 (or their already opted-in reader version).
Promotion rolls back with a failed transaction and never downgrades through an
older barrier call. Existing version-9-or-earlier binaries must refuse the store.
Sealed transfer of version-10 stores is unsupported and fails closed; existing
sealed-store semantics are not expanded by this revision. This source-level
barrier test does not replace frozen-binary counterexample 2.

## Reviewed configuration decoration (in progress)

The existing process-change request accepts optional `execution_configuration`, an
exact stored v2 configuration artifact reference. P validates its publication,
current definitions and package registration before preparing a change ticket.
The existing signed process review still supplies the graph, host/resource set,
conditions, completion rules and budgets. Removing only the v2 execution binding
and restoring the reviewed template recipe must make the candidate byte-identical
to that reviewed target; changes to any other field are refused. This reuses the
review as component evidence and does not turn a fixed-input approval into a
variable-input execution grant.

The reference is retained in the immutable change plan and checked again for
proposal/staging. Existing impact review, reviewer separation and resource/run
blockers remain in force. Legacy requests omit the new field and preserve their
serialization/digest calculation. The builder source identity changes, so older
unapplied plans must be reproposed rather than silently treated as current.

A v2 target never produces a v1 Host binding plan. Its P-side dispatch now uses the
[v2 Host contract](../../host-configuration/v2/README.md), with durable original
requests, policy-aware receipts and current-read evidence. The temporary blanket
v2 application refusal is removed; unchanged review/fence/resource/generation
gates plus explicit v2 evidence govern applicability. A v1 reply cannot satisfy
those gates. P integration tests now exercise signed package intake/publication,
process and impact reviews, registered Host identities, fences and simulated v2
acknowledgement through atomic unqualified application. Lost apply responses recover
the original result; current definition drift blocks new apply without preventing
original-request lookup. These are application-transaction tests, not native Host
execution or frozen-binary compatibility. Host qualification/recovery v2 adapters,
Run/Executor and M3 acceptance remain first-gate/subsequent milestone work as applicable.


## Qualification of the derived domain

The [execution-v2 Host qualification contract](../../host-qualification/v2/README.md)
binds issuance and acknowledgement to the original v2 configuration request/receipt,
publication and policy. P retains separate durable v1/v2 tasks and fresh Host-read
checks. Explicit policy-v3 issuance/activation repeats and compares the saved derived
proof; its computation tickets expire at600seconds, while legacy tickets keep30seconds.
Definition drift blocks readiness without preventing historical qualification views.

P transaction tests cover report/independent decision/issuance/activation with simulated
Host acknowledgements, lost activation replies, acceptance at599seconds and rejection
at exactly600seconds (valid actor sessions/grants and independently refreshed Host
reads). Wrong current policy suspends qualification; definition revision drift removes
readiness even when values match. A qualified v2 configuration still cannot create a
legacy Run. These tests do not establish native Host/Executor effects, Linux latency,
frozen-v1 compatibility, or M3 acceptance.


## Actual-instance and slot binding primitives

`OBJECT_INSTANCE` is distinct from ObjectModel/ResourceInstance and inherits one
ObjectModel with checked fields and explicit value provenance. Catalog persistence
requires reader10. InputClosure.object_projection checks the full effective schema
and values against exactly one approved model; equal-value instance overrides keep
their provenance without expanding the domain. A model alone, changed value or an
ambiguous candidate is refused. These pure checks grant no operating authority.

InputClosure.slot_resources discovers Pattern sources on active Task properties
from the saved input closure, validates explicit geometry and actual ResourceInstance
identity across candidates, and deduplicates repeated contexts. Layout identity pins
resource/pattern revisions, capacity and resolver identity. No cell-specific context
name is used. Missing/ambiguous subjects, competing layouts, invalid geometry and
capacity outside1..2400 fail closed. P now persists pool ownership/initialization/reservation and Prepared Run bindings;
Part admission and operation permits still require the explicit v2 execution path.

Selection.ordinal is the Run-local one-based Part ordinal. The mandatory
slot_ordinal is the one-based rank in the complete publication slot order and maps
to the zero-based slot; an earlier Run's consumption cannot be hidden by resetting
its Part ordinal. The authority must supply the reserved rank and check every field;
this DTO does not allocate slots or authorize caller-selected indices.


## Persistent simulation inventory and Prepared Runs

P derives the complete pool set from the current published closure. Pools use
catalog/ResourceInstance identity, never revision/publication/Run identity. Explicit
operator terminal initialization or replenishment checks simulation scope, current
layout, expected generation and the existing shared quiescence guard. Previous
generations and Run bindings remain immutable history. A new Run atomically reserves
the first N jointly unused approved indices across every pool or records nothing.
Abandonment, a new Run ID, original-key replay and partial pool reset do not free slots.

The same writer provides `/api/v1/workflow-executions/slot-pools`, `/runs` and
`/objects`. Actual object binding checks the current instance/model/value projection,
next Part ordinal, pool generation and reserved ownership, then records the source
actor/request and stable instance custody. Revising an instance or replenishing stock
does not make that identity available to another Run. Original replies and read-only
history survive revision changes and restart without renewing authority.

Inventory APIs produce a Prepared Run and pending actual-object binding, not permission
to dispatch. Legacy Start/BeginPart cannot activate them. The explicit P Start2/Part2
path below consumes these records; per-node selection/permit, completion/UNKNOWN
settlement and the deployed Executor2 remain required. Transaction tests include signed qualification first,
simulated Host acknowledgement, two distinct pools, commit/reply loss, cross-Run and
revision reuse refusals, explicit replenishment and actual SQLite reopen; they are
not native operating or M3 acceptance evidence.


## Negotiated P Start2 and Part2

The [Executor admission contract](../../executor-execution/v2/README.md) uses a separate
v2 binding declaration on the current registered Executor peer/cell. P stores its
session/runtime/store/definition identity; matching a public hash is not attestation
or an operation permit. Start2 runs the existing terminal, purpose, conditions, Host
arm and mandate path, with exact reserved budget and current object/pool checks again
at the final arm acknowledgement. Legacy start/part requests cannot opt in.

Part2 uses a P-created non-deserializable computation ticket. Materialization and
approved-index verification occur off-writer; commit rechecks current state and saves
the immutable report/parameters, normal PartAttempt, one budget consumption and pool
Part ownership atomically. Replaying the original key returns the same Part; the
unfinished Part blocks another slot. Authenticated v2 reads permit only that Run/Part's
bound artifacts. Instance drift before the final arm or after CPU verification blocks
new admission while original artifacts remain readable.

Current evidence is P transaction tests with registered Executor identity and simulated
Host acknowledgements. The service is wired into the existing TLS peer ingress; no
new native Executor/Host effect, frozen-binary case2 or M3 acceptance is established
by these tests. Node-operation admission and recovery/completion remain incomplete.
